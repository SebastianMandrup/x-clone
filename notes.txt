- assets served directly from directory
    - ie contact-us.html

- change html to php my changing the suffix

- use __DIR__ over relative path

- . to contact

- require / require_once && inclue / include_once
    - require throws error if file is not found
    - include does not throw an error
    - always point to __DIR__

- in a docker environment you can never point to local host
    - must point to the name of the container (db.php)
